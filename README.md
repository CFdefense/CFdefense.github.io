To showcase my projects and professional experiences, I developed a portfolio website using Vite and React, styled with Tailwind CSS. I chose Vite for its fast development environment and optimized build performance. Additionally, I selected React for its component-based architecture, which allows for reusable and maintainable code, making it easy to update and manage different sections of my portfolio. The rich ecosystem surrounding React, including tools like React Router for seamless navigation, further eased the development process. On the other hand, I opted for Tailwind CSS due to its utility-first approach, which enables rapid UI development with minimal custom CSS. 
<br /> <br />
This framework allowed me to create a visually appealing and responsive design quickly, ensuring consistency and efficiency throughout the website. The combination of React and Tailwind CSS empowered me to create a modern, interactive portfolio that effectively showcases my skills and experiences despite not having extensive web development experience. These tools proved easy to learn and develop with, providing me with a fun and interesting project that not only showcases my skills but also effectively highlights all my other work.
<br /> <br />
To enhance my portfolio website's user experience, I used React Router DOM for seamless transitions between sections, allowing smooth navigation without full-page reloads. I also integrated animations with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion, creating engaging effects as elements enter and exit the viewport
